# General stuff about how the code should look

- readability please
- camel case preferred
- comment functions with what they do
- comment things that need an explanation

### Special comments
I use some special comments so that I can come back to things later

- "TODO" simply a quick note on something that needs to be done.
- "DEBUG" code that is there for debugging purposes that should probably be commented out or deleted. (I'll end the block with a /DEBUG too)
