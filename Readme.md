# Beads
This is a program to duplicate the functionality of BeadSurge version 1. (TODO make a real name. MooseEatsBeads? lol)

Pretty much the purpose of this program is to take an image file and convert it to a format that is useful for beading. (TODO reword this lol)


## Install

Java version 16 (or something) needs to be installed. Java.com if you don't have it.
Download the latest beads.jar file from the bin/ folder
Double click it.
A config file and save files will be made in the directory where it is. So probably move it out of your downloads or documents folder. (TODO system dependent config storage and installer)


## Coding Setup

for now: eclipse v. 4.20.0 // ohhhh 420 (sryihadto)

Eventually I would like to have this done in command line with a Bash script or something. Terminal life is best life.

This is a required package.
