# MooseEatsBeads
This is a program to duplicate the functionality of BeadSurge version 1.

The purpose of this program is to take an image file and convert it to a format that is useful for beading. (TODO reword this lol)


## Install

Java version 16 (or something) needs to be installed. Java.com if you don't have it.
Download the latest MooseEatsBeads.jar and run.bat file from the build/ folder
Then double click run.bat (hopefully. please java. just work.)



## Coding Setup

for now: eclipse v. 4.20.0
OpenJDK version 16  (There were some issues, please make sure it runs on JRE 1.8 before commit)

Eventually I would like to have this done in command line with a Bash script or something. Terminal life is best life.

This is a required package.
