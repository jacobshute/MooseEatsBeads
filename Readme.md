# MooseEatsBeads
This is a program to duplicate the functionality of BeadSurge version 1.

The purpose of this program is to take an image file and convert it to a format that is useful for beading. (TODO reword this lol)


## Install

Download the MooseEatsBeads.zip,
Extract,
Then double click run.bat (hopefully. please java. just work.)


To run the Jar file without downloading the entire zip:
Java version 11 needs to be installed. Java.com if you don't have it.
Javafx 11 needs to be in the module path
good luck.

## Coding Setup

OpenJDK version 11
Javafx version 11 
Bash of some sort (git-bash works great)
Text Editor (jacobshute uses VSCode but anything should work)
